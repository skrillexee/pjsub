        "text": "The game has two modes to it: Story Mode and Endless Mode. Endless Mode is essentially the same as the Story Mode, except the notebook fetch quest never ends, with the notebooks respawning occasionally and your goal being to collect as many as possible. Thus for this guide well generally focus on Story Mode.

The object of the games story mode is to collect seven notebooks scattered throughout the school a map of the school is in the section here. Aside from collecting the initial two notebooks near the start, theres no apparent correct order in which to grab them. Each notebook will pose you with several math problems in the first notebook, the three questions can all be answered, but subsequent notebooks always have a messed up third question you can nver answer correctly.

After answering the second notebook glitched question - or if you answered the questions in the first book wrong, after that - Baldi will begin to chase you. With each notebook  incorrect answer previous versions, Baldi will speed up as well. You can hear him as he whacks his ruler against his hand both as a means of somewhat understanding his location and how fast hes moving: the faster hes slapping, the faster hes going. With each slap, he moves a set distance forward in the direction that minimizes the distance to you. If Baldi catches you, the game is over. Boom.

During the course of this notebook fetch quest, youll also encounter a number of other enemies that will generally serve to either directly impede you by wasting time, or by just screwing with you. Further details on each and how to deal with them are in the CharactersEnemies section.

After collecting all seven notebooks, what has been dubbed the Final Mode begins. You will need to escape the school while Baldi moves at his fastest pace yet. You will end up having to go to each of the schools four exits - regardless of the order you go to them in, the first three will be fake, and once you make it to the last one you win..",
